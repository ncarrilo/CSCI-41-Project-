# CSCI-41-Project-
Project by Nathaniel Carrillo, Jacob Galaviz 

This program allows the user to view up to twenty 
different streaming services along with 
being given the option to add or delete entries 

Then the user will be given the option to either 1. View the currently
exsting data, 2. To change or edit the streaming serive entries 
and 3. To exit, which will close the program entirely. 

**Project 4: Linked List**

In streamCharge.cpp we have implemented a linked list that allows the user to view the charges
that streaming services charge. We have also allowed the user to add and remove charges, as well as 
search for specific charges.
